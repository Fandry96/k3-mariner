**Target**: r/googleantigravity

---

### The 5-Year-Old Explanation 👶

**Google:** "We built a super-smart robot called *Project Mariner* that can surf the web and do your homework! But you can't play with it yet. It's a secret." 🤫

**Us:** "Fine. We'll build our own." 🛠️

### Introducing: K3 Mariner (Community Edition)

We built an open-source clone of Google's agent. It lives on your computer. It uses the Gemini API. It surfs the web. It writes code. And unlike Google's version, **you can download it right now.**

### "What can it do?"

1. **It creates:** You ask it to "Make a snake game", and it writes the code and runs it.
2. **It surfs:** You ask it to "Find the cheapest RTX 5080", and it searches the web.
3. **It learns:** It connects to your local files to remember stuff (Coming Soon).

### "Is it hard to run?"

Nope.

1. Download code.
2. Click `run`.
3. Type in your Google API key (The free one works).
4. Watch it go.

We even built a pretty dashboard so you can see its "Brain" working in real-time. No black boxes.
